## About  

The *NBA Player Stats Explorer* aims to allow users to visually explore statistics related to the play during the 2015/2016 season of the National Basketball Association (or *NBA*). 

NBA statistics are available in a number of places, but custom plotting of one statistic against another is nowhere to be found (to my admittedly limited knowledge). It will allow all NBA fans to get new insight on the abilities of their favorite players, and compare players against one another on various "profiles". For a *basic* example, you could ask "Who are the best inside-out players in the league?", and get a reasonable answer by plotting Rebounds against 3 point shots made.
